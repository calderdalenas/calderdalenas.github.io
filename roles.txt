## calderdalenas.org.uk

In order to have a constant and easily identifiable website we need to renew the 'domain' every year. I use a company called [Hover](1) to do this, but you can use any company that sells domains. However you need to be careful that they do not try and sell lots of add ons as this can increase the cost. The domain is simply the name, it is **NOT** the website. Think of it as a sign that points to your shop. The details for the domain point to where the website is actually hosted. This costs just under £15 per year.

## Website

You can use any method to build a website and then make sure the domain points to that location. The one I use is not a simple method at all, so without someone with a high degree of technical knowledge this would probably have to change. However the content of the website can easily be passed on and added to another system. The current method is completely free and needs no adverts to be displayed and is completely under our control.

[Squarespace](2) is a very user friendly way to build a website but comes at a monthly cost.

## Twitter

I don't really do anything with twitter for various reasons but we do own @calderdalenas on twitter. Login details are in OWA.

## Mailing List

I use a company called [MailChimp](3) to do this. Now that we have transferred the emails from OWA to MailChimp we do not have to worry so much about checking for people who want to unsubscribe as MailChimp offers a simple link which allows people to unsubscribe. By default I **ONLY** add emails to the subscribers list, not names as this means it would be very difficult to fall foul of data protection laws as just an email does not contain personal information, even if a name is visible. If anyone is to be included on the mailing list, they should be added to this list, **NOT** to OWA as OWA is unreliable, difficult to search and fails to send out emails to more than a few people. There is an easy signup form on the website so that anyone can join the mailing list without us having to add them. If someone does add themselves, an email alert goes to the CNAS email to let us know. 

There are some emails with names attached, these are people who have asked to volunteer, regular volunteers and committee members so we can see who they are. All these people are tagged so that we can target just them with a mail shot if we want to.

Mail Chimp is completely free for up to 2000 subscribers and up to 12000 emails per month, so it is extremely unlikely that we would ever have to pay for this service. They offer a set of templates you can use for the emails and it is very user friendly. There are reports on who has opened any emails and also who has unsubscribed.

Login details are in the OWA task list.

## Surveys

To do quick and easy online surveys I use a company called [Survey Monkey](4). Again this is free for small and simple surveys. Login details are in the OWA task list.
