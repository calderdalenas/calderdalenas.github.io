        <title>The Future of CAMHS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Many of our NAS families have personal experiences of the local CAMHS services (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service). Some of you have been kind enough to share your experiences, which will hopefully help to reshape the future of the emotional health and wellbeing service. The redevelopment of CAMHS may even see a name change!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2016 I attended a meeting with other organisations, with the purpose of discussing the design of our future specialist emotional health and wellbeing services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were given the opportunity to discuss positive and negative experiences of the service. I welcomed this chance to feedback experiences and views that have been shared by Calderdale NAS members in our recent questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also discussed around 50 gaps in services around the topic of emotional health and wellbeing.  We each voted for the 3 gaps which we felt was important and perhaps missing. The highest two were;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support and continued support/links after ASD/ ADHD diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dedicated CAMHS in school (training or recruiting a member of staff to provide tier 1 emotional health support and providing the funding and toolkit to do this.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also discussed that there is a need to develop a first point of contact for CAMHS. The next few months will be crucial in agencies developing a specification for this new model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the event, gaps in services were acknowledged and positive changes are very much a priority. It was also a great opportunity to learn from CAMHS professionals, who really want to make these changes and were very vocal in the need for support after ASD diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will keep you informed on any future changes. In the meantime, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.calderdaleccg.nhs.uk/news/calderdales-local-transformation-plan-for-emotional-health-and-wellbeing/&quot;&gt;here is a link to the recent transformation plan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Calderdale Adult Autism Strategy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The first Calderdale Autism Strategy was produced in 2012. This is the second local strategy covering the next three years. The Autism Strategy Group consists of people with Aspergers and family members and staff from Adult Social Care, the Clinical Commissioning Group, South West Yorkshire Trust, Health, Education, Job Centre Plus and Criminal Justice sector, NAS, voluntary organisations and providers.
The group meets quarterly to oversee the implementation of the strategy and action plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read the &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/CALDERDALE_AUTISM_STRATEGY_2015-2018.doc&quot;&gt;strategy for 2015-18 here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Climbing High with Calderdale NAS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image featured&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rokt_2016.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
Our first event of 2016 was at ROKT Climbing Gym in Brighouse. We started off bouldering and caving, with everyone choosing whatever they felt comfortable with doing. There was a lot of stairs to walk up to get to the first activities which got our legs working. I was very impressed by how brave everyone who crawled into the very small hole for the caving was! The bouldering was tricky but everyone soon got the hang of it. Once we were all warmed up we went down to the huge climbing wall which I felt dizzy just looking at. However our fearless climbers, once they were strapped up and securely roped to the instructors, took no time to scale the dizzying heights! All in all it was a great start to the year and really blew away the January cobwebs. It was also good to support a local business that had been affected by the recent floods. Watch out for our next event which is rollerskating in February.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Care Act Information Session</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hft.org.uk/Supporting-people/Family-carers/Family-Carer-Support-Workshops/care-act-workshops/&quot;&gt;The Care Act&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most important pieces of legislation for a long time.  It brings some really positive changes for both carers and disabled people and puts an emphasis on ‘wellbeing’. This means that when people are being assessed for support, services have to take their quality of life into consideration. For the first time, ‘care’ is about more than survival, it is about having a life!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Care Act applies to adults but even if your child is at secondary school now, especially over 14 years it will be useful for you to find out about your rights because that 16th birthday will come quickly.  HFT are a national organisation with expertise in supporting families of people with learning disabilities and autism.  We don’t often get a chance to benefit from their knowledge and skills in Calderdale, they usually visit big cities, so please come along and arm yourself with information about rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To book a place, please contact Lauren Ellis or Amanda Rorrison at CPC on 01422 343090 or email &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#102;&amp;#111;&amp;#064;&amp;#099;&amp;#112;&amp;#097;&amp;#110;&amp;#100;&amp;#099;&amp;#046;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#103;&amp;#046;&amp;#117;&amp;#107;&quot;&gt;&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#102;&amp;#111;&amp;#064;&amp;#099;&amp;#112;&amp;#097;&amp;#110;&amp;#100;&amp;#099;&amp;#046;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#103;&amp;#046;&amp;#117;&amp;#107;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
