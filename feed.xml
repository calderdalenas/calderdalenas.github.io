        <title>Care Act Information Session</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hft.org.uk/Supporting-people/Family-carers/Family-Carer-Support-Workshops/care-act-workshops/&quot;&gt;The Care Act&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most important pieces of legislation for a long time.  It brings some really positive changes for both carers and disabled people and puts an emphasis on ‘wellbeing’. This means that when people are being assessed for support, services have to take their quality of life into consideration. For the first time, ‘care’ is about more than survival, it is about having a life! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Care Act applies to adults but even if your child is at secondary school now, especially over 14 years it will be useful for you to find out about your rights because that 16th birthday will come quickly.  HFT are a national organisation with expertise in supporting families of people with learning disabilities and autism.  We don’t often get a chance to benefit from their knowledge and skills in Calderdale, they usually visit big cities, so please come along and arm yourself with information about rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To book a place, please contact Lauren Ellis or Amanda Rorrison at CPC on 01422 343090 or email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@cpandc.org.uk&quot;&gt;info@cpandc.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
