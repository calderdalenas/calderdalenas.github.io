        <p>Many of our NAS families have personal experiences of the local CAMHS services (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service). Some of you have been kind enough to share your experiences, which will hopefully help to reshape the future of the emotional health and wellbeing service. The redevelopment of CAMHS may even see a name change!</p>

<p>In January 2016 I attended a meeting with other organisations, with the purpose of discussing the design of our future specialist emotional health and wellbeing services.</p>

<p>We were given the opportunity to discuss positive and negative experiences of the service. I welcomed this chance to feedback experiences and views that have been shared by Calderdale NAS members in our recent questionnaires.</p>

<p>We also discussed around 50 gaps in services around the topic of emotional health and wellbeing.  We each voted for the 3 gaps which we felt was important and perhaps missing. The highest two were;</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support and continued support/links after ASD/ ADHD diagnosis.</li>
  <li>Dedicated CAMHS in school (training or recruiting a member of staff to provide tier 1 emotional health support and providing the funding and toolkit to do this.)</li>
</ul>

<p>It was also discussed that there is a need to develop a first point of contact for CAMHS. The next few months will be crucial in agencies developing a specification for this new model.</p>

<p>At the event, gaps in services were acknowledged and positive changes are very much a priority. It was also a great opportunity to learn from CAMHS professionals, who really want to make these changes and were very vocal in the need for support after ASD diagnosis.</p>

<p>We will keep you informed on any future changes. In the meantime, <a href="http://www.calderdaleccg.nhs.uk/news/calderdales-local-transformation-plan-for-emotional-health-and-wellbeing/">here is a link to the recent transformation plan</a>.</p>
